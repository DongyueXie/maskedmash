## Introduction

I tried to let Empirikos return the confidence interval of lfdr, by setting 
`targets =  Empirikos.PosteriorProbability.(StandardNormalSample.(-5:0.2:5), Interval(0, 0))`. The `Interval(0, 0)` stands for $p(\mu = 0)$.

```{r}
ebci_lfdr = read.csv('output/ebci/lfdr/spiky_lfdr_first5.csv')
head(ebci_lfdr)
```


It does not work because all the lower and upper bound returned are zeros.
